===========

Glyphfriend is a Visual Studio 2017 extension to enhance the existing Intellisense to display preview glyphs for many of the common glyph-based font libraries like Font Awesome, Bootstrap, and much more.

## Supported Glyphs and Libraries

* [Bootstrap Glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons)
* [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/) 
* [Material Design](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
* [MetroUI](https://metroui.org.ua/)
* [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/)

## Getting Started

You can [download and install Glyphfriend from the Visual Studio Gallery here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RionWilliams.Glyphfriend2017) or simply search for it within the **Tools > Extensions and Updates** area of Visual Studio.

After installing the extension, that's it. Glyphfriend will automatically detect when a valid HTML flavored file is opened and it will add all of the supported icons to the autocompletion within `class` attributes as seen below :

## Missing Something?

Pull Requests are openly accepted and encouraged. 

The libraries that were chosen were just some of the more common ones that I had come across, but I am sure that I left quite a few out. If you find that one of your favorites is missing, you can either report it within the [Issues](https://github.com/Rionmonster/Glyphfriend/issues) area or 
just clone this repository, make a fork and add your changes (and then just make a pull request when you are all done).

## Thanks

There are a few folks that I would like to give a special shout-out to several members of the Visual Studio Tooling team for the help and guidance in developing this project, and espeically during the migration over to Visual Studio 2017 :
