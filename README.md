Glyphfriend
===========

Glyphfriend is a Visual Studio 2015 extension to enhance the existing Intellisense to display preview glyphs for many of the common glyph-based font libraries like Font Awesome, Foundation, IonIcons and more.

## Supported Glyphs and Libraries

* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/) 
* [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/)

A subset of the [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/) found in the Twitter Bootstrap library are suported; however there is presently a conflict with the built-in Intellsense in Visual Studio 2015 that can 
cause these items to be overridden.

## Getting Started

You can [download and install Glyphfriend from the Visual Studio Gallery here](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5fd24afb-b3b2-4cec-9b03-1cfcec6123aa).

## Missing Something?

Pull Requests are openly accepted and encouraged. 

The libraries that were chosen were just some of the most common ones that I had come across, but I am sure that I left quite a few out. If you find that one of your favorites is missing, you can either report it within the Issues area or 
just clone this repository, make a fork and add your changes (and then just make a pull request when you are all done).

## Thanks

I just want to give a big thanks to [Mads Kristensen](https://github.com/madskristensen) for all of his assistance with this project (and getting me interested in Visual Studio Extension development).
