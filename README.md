Glyphfriend
===========

Glyphfriend is a Visual Studio extension to enhance the existing Intellisense to display preview glyphs for many of the common glyph-based font libraries like Font Awesome, Foundation, IonIcons and more.

## Supported Glyphs and Libraries

* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/) 
* [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/)

A subset of the [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/) found in the Twitter Bootstrap library are suported; however there is presently a conflict with the built-in Intellsense in Visual Studio 2015 that can
cause these items to be overridden.
